# Performance Optimizations Implemented

## Task 19: Performance Optimizations

This document summarizes all performance optimizations implemented for the Warehouse Management System.

### 1. Database Indexes Added

#### Stock Movements Table

Already had indexes on:

-   `product_id` - for filtering by product
-   `created_at` - for date-based queries
-   `reference_type`, `reference_id` - for polymorphic relationships
-   `type` - for filtering by movement type

#### Purchase Orders Table

Added new indexes:

-   `order_date` - for date range filtering and sorting
-   `expected_date` - for date range filtering and sorting

Already had indexes on:

-   `po_number` - for unique lookups
-   `supplier_id` - for supplier filtering
-   `status` - for status filtering

#### Sales Orders Table

Added new indexes:

-   `order_date` - for date range filtering and sorting

Already had indexes on:

-   `so_number` - for unique lookups
-   `customer_id` - for customer filtering
-   `status` - for status filtering

### 2. Eager Loading in Filament Resources

Implemented `modifyQueryUsing()` with eager loading in all table schemas to prevent N+1 queries:

#### ProductTable

```php
->modifyQueryUsing(fn (Builder $query) => $query->with(['category']))
```

#### PurchaseOrderTable

```php
->modifyQueryUsing(fn (Builder $query) => $query->with(['supplier', 'creator']))
```

#### SalesOrderTable

```php
->modifyQueryUsing(fn (Builder $query) => $query->with(['customer', 'salesUser']))
```

#### InboundOperationTable

```php
->modifyQueryUsing(fn (Builder $query) => $query->with(['purchaseOrder.supplier', 'receiver', 'stockMovements']))
```

#### OutboundOperationTable

```php
->modifyQueryUsing(fn (Builder $query) => $query->with(['salesOrder.customer', 'preparer', 'stockMovements']))
```

#### DeliveryOrderTable

```php
->modifyQueryUsing(fn (Builder $query) => $query->with(['outboundOperation.salesOrder.customer', 'driver', 'vehicle']))
```

#### InvoiceTable

```php
->modifyQueryUsing(fn (Builder $query) => $query->with(['salesOrder.customer']))
```

#### StockOpnameTable

```php
->modifyQueryUsing(fn ($query) => $query->with(['items', 'creator', 'stockMovements']))
```

### 3. Caching for Dashboard Statistics

Implemented 5-minute cache TTL for dashboard statistics in `StatsOverview` widget:

-   **Total Stock Value**: Cached with key `dashboard_total_stock_value` (300 seconds)
-   **Total Customers**: Cached with key `dashboard_total_customers` (300 seconds)
-   **Inbound Today**: Cached with key `dashboard_inbound_today_{date}` (300 seconds)
-   **Outbound Today**: Cached with key `dashboard_outbound_today_{date}` (300 seconds)

### 4. Caching for Product Stock Calculations

Implemented 1-hour cache TTL for product stock calculations in `StockMovementService`:

-   **getCurrentStock()**: Cached with key `product_stock_{product_id}` (3600 seconds)
-   Stock is calculated from sum of all stock movements
-   Cache is automatically used by Product model's `getCurrentStock()` method

### 5. Cache Invalidation on Stock Movement Creation

Implemented automatic cache invalidation in `StockMovementService` when stock movements are created:

-   **Product Stock Cache**: Invalidated when inbound, outbound, or adjustment is recorded
-   **Dashboard Statistics Cache**: Invalidated to ensure real-time accuracy
    -   `dashboard_total_stock_value`
    -   `dashboard_inbound_today_{date}`
    -   `dashboard_outbound_today_{date}`

Cache invalidation occurs in:

-   `recordInbound()` - after creating inbound stock movements
-   `recordOutbound()` - after creating outbound stock movements
-   `recordAdjustment()` - after creating adjustment stock movements

### 6. Product Model Optimization

Updated `Product` model to use cached stock calculations:

-   `getCurrentStock()` now uses `StockMovementService::getCurrentStock()` which implements caching
-   `getStockValue()` and `isLowStock()` benefit from cached stock values

## Performance Impact

These optimizations provide:

1. **Faster Database Queries**: Indexes on date columns speed up filtering and sorting operations
2. **Reduced N+1 Queries**: Eager loading eliminates multiple database queries when displaying lists
3. **Faster Dashboard Loading**: 5-minute cache reduces repeated calculations for statistics
4. **Faster Stock Lookups**: 1-hour cache eliminates repeated sum calculations for product stock
5. **Real-time Accuracy**: Cache invalidation ensures data consistency when stock changes

## Requirements Satisfied
